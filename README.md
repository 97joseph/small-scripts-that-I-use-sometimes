# Important scripts that I may use sometimes when it is necessary

## makefolders.sh

### For those who prefer being complicated

To make your computer a labyrinth that no one can navigate, use this bash script to create 100 folders in the current directory with their only form of identification being a number between 1 and 100.

Perfect for hiding your documents when no one around you knows how to use grep or anyother commands.

## synchronize.py and synchronizeEx.json

### Keeping backups without needing the internet

I have a USB drive which I keep some of my most valuable files on it. 

-School Labs

-Academic Papers

-Useful, Portable Code

-Memes

That being said, it's very hard and annoying to copy and paste everything using finder and guis. So I made this to simplify the task.

In synchonizeEx.json, folder1 is the source folder while folder2 is the destination folder. I made a time value so that it'll only copy items made after the last copy, don't worry about putting some arbitrary time at first, just put the folders in and you'll be good.
